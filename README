Hello, I am writing to notify you of some details while testing. 
Due to the server being very efficient on the cloudlab, we had trouble losing packets no matter how many client threads we had.
In order to resolve this, we introduced an artificial server delay of 50 ms (usleep function call). 
This delay is only present to present the unreliability of UDP on a busy server. 
With this in mind, when testing, we would recommend keeping the message amount to 100 or less 
(We tested task 1 with 100 messages, and were able to get 0 packet loss with 2 and 15 threads, 50 packets lost with 30 threads, and 70 packets lost with 50 threads.)
This delay is also present in task 2, as we wanted to display the ability of our retransmission algorithm to ensure that there is no packet loss regardless of a busy server. 
Once again, due to this delay, We recommend keeping the number of requests down to 100 or less (it still works with a lot of requests, but takes a lot longer.)
